# Movies-ETL

## 5 Assumptions:
#1 - The python data will not run if proper indentation is not aligned within VS Code. For example, certain functions may require an extra indentation to show that it is doing something new and not effecting what the previous function is doing for 
the code. 

#2 - Using Try-Except Blocks can help automate the ETL script to make it more vigoruous to certain errors that may occur. 

#3 - It is best to add a function to check how much time has passed when reading/importing certain files that have a large chunksize, such as the final amount of rows that were being imported at the end of our code. 

#4 - Certain parts of the code may not run without checking the proper imports and including functions that will allow it to run, such as the "psycop" function that was needed to be embedded within the code. 

#5 - ETL can be successfully used to extract data from various sources, change the data in whatever manner it may be needed, and move it into single location that will be its desired destination.
